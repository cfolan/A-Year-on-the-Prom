									<p>	I arrived on the Prom at around 7.20am.  The sun was up and shining on a glorious Galway Bay. Very little wind for a change. As I walked to the headland at Grattan beach I passed the wild flowers growing along the path which was alive with little birds singing their hearts out. The sunlight lit up Salthill so beautifully I decided to paint that view from headland at Grattan beach. Not too many people around, some people doing Tai Chi near me and I can well understand how wonderful it must been. The skies kept changing as I tried to capture them! The tide was going out so I needed to keep up with that too.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>The seaweed on the beach looks a dirty brown at first glance but within it you can see lovely ochres and deep reds and sienna and deep umber. The green algae is a lovely contrast to the reddish browns.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>As I finished 2 hours later as a heavy shower dumped on me. Luckily I had packed most of the stuff up and could hide under an umbrella and finish my lovely hot coffee.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>AAh well, it is July in Galway after all!.   Happy Racing everyone!</p>

									<p>	My Lord what a day!! I figure this is the only day I could possibly stand and sketch a storm, as I would freeze in winter. Even so, I stood in the shelter nearest Blackrock but still got soaked!</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>I primed the canvas in acrylic beforehand and I figured I could sketch in oil crayons but I hadn’t reckoned on the driving rain soaking the canvas. I could not possibly have held a brush. I even tied a belt onto the brace of the canvas and looped it on my wrist and only for that it would have taken off!! I wedged the canvas against the wall of the shelter and I did the best I could. I hung the crayons in a freezer bag from my neck!</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>Can’t stop thinking of Mr. Turner being strapped to the mast during a storm!! If that really happened, he was one brave guy… or nuts!!!</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>I have now done a quick palette knife sketch in oils while it’s still fresh in my head! It is almost high tide with gusts of 80 to 100 km/hr and driving rain!!</p>

									<p>This is how beautiful it can be!!  7.30am is a lovely time to be on the Prom as quite a few people already realise.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>Once again I had difficulty choosing a view to paint. The light on the Clare hills was very interesting. I will be back for that again.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>I finally settled on the view looking south west, taking in the shelter, little shop, Blackrock and Gentian Hill.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>The tide is creeping in as I paint and the clouds on the horizon are gently building! The Blues were so beautiful I used cerulean and a smidgen of ultramarine . The sand appears to have a bluey tinge in places. The shadows on the rocks in the water and at the edge of the Prom help give some contrast in the composition. I need strong highlight to separate rocks along the Prom from the light coloured sand of the beach below. Do I include people who are always passing by?? I think I should, as people are such an important part of our view of the Prom. They were very considerate of my presence and respectful that I did not have too much time to chat!.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>For once, as I painted, I had to take off my jacket and then my scarf as the rising sun heated up.

									<p>Just back from painting the moon on the Prom. Tried last night but there was too much cloud coverage. Tonight it was just stunning! I could have started earlier and gone on all night. As the moon rose the light on the sea kept changing.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>It was very strange painting at night by the light of a street lamp. It was very hard to see the colours so I was just trying to recreate the tones I saw. The water appeared pitch black and the reflection of moonlight was silvery blue in places and yellowy in other places. Also the tiny breeze caused ripples on the water which altered the reflection even as I was working on it.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>Such a beautiful night! The basic camera just does not do it justice. I realise more and more how important it is to get out there. There were a lot of people out walking and, as usual, they were very encouraging!</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>I used a lot of black (shock horror!).  Anyone who knows me knows that I don’t usually use black. I needed some quick way to capture the dark dark sea. I also mixed it with blue and a little white to get the sky colour. We will see what I do with the oils!! I have to say it gave me the effect I wanted!!</p>

									<p>After a few very cloudy days the sun has appeared in all its September glory. I went to the IMG_6366Prom to try and capture that lovely glistening sea. I started at approximately 2 o’clock and the sun was high in the sky. The sky was a very hazy pale blue with gentle white clouds passing by. There was a tinge of bluey grey in the body of the clouds. As I sketched them they were changing and sometimes disappearing bringing to mind ‘will of the wisps’!</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>I settled on painting the main beach with the old swimming pools as the main structure in the painting. The Clare Hills stood out with the most lovely blue which contrasted so well with the sky. The colour of the sea was more grey blue than blue as you would expect.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>The glistening of the sunshine on the sea was magical and even that was changing as I was trying to capture it. I see so many colours in that glistening on the sea it is quite a challenge to get it right.
									I noticed the way the sunlight touched the top of the waves and makes the movement of the water visible. I will be adding people to the beach when completing the painting. I just concentrated on the light for this sketch.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>Two lads were sitting directly in front of me down on the beach, one was strumming a guitar and the other had his hand outstretched taking a selfie, they are definitely going in!
									Met a few friends and some other nice people. I am beginning to enjoy this!</p>

									<p>I won’t have too many free mornings in the near future so I took the opportunity to capture this lovely scene at 11 o’clock this morning. 1609The tide was going out and clouds were building on the horizon, but the grey blues of the sea and the wet sand were worth trying to capture. Again there was lovely contrast to all the bluey greys with the green algae and umber seaweed and the pale coloured ochre stones of the causeway. Mutton island was very visible and led the eye into the composition which was an added element. Looking closely, I could see the hills and landscape of Rinville appearing as a very pale blue behind Mutton island, although it isn’t really an island anymore!</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>Also along the horizon, at the base of those hills, the low tide exposed land which appeared dark brown with touches of yellow ochre. It’s is amazing what you see when you really look at something!</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>I really loved the sky this morning full of movement but bright and cheerful and all the colours in it were reflected in the landscape. The whitish highlight in the building bluey grey clouds on the horizon, had a touch of ochre and indeed I added a tiny touch of red to warm the highlight up more. This contrasted with the cooler whites of the higher up clouds and strata.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>I love the light and air in September on days like this, I hope you enjoy it too!</p>

									<p>I passed the Oyster tent on Nimmos pier ( it being Oyster Festival Weekend ) as I made my way to South Park. I arrived just in time to see the first glimmer of sunrise on this beautiful September morning. There was quite a breeze so I was very glad to set up my easel behind the one and only bush on South Park! I wanted to paint Mutton island lighthouse with the sun shining on it and so I had to get up early. It was so worth it.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>As I was setting the easel up, the sun was rising over Renmore, the seagulls were basking in the shallows of the outgoing tide and the little birds were busy hopping through the sand and seaweed. There were quite a few early walkers and joggers about.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>I concentrated on sketching the shoreline and capturing the lighthouse initially, as the sky was fairly uninteresting. The light on the rocks, grasses and on Mutton Island was what was attracting me to this scene. Yellow ochre featured predominately with burnt umber for rocks and seaweed.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>The hills of Clare seemed to appear and disappear through low cloud as the morning progressed so I left them until last and gave them one shot!! I am fairly happy the way they turned out. The Sky got bluer and the hazy cloud burned off as the sun rose just leaving a few little clouds lurking around the hills.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>As I was leaving, men were arriving to set up the pitches with goal nets and flags etc! Lots of dogs and owners were out in force too making the most of a great morning.</p>

									<p>There was a beautiful calm grey dawn this morning over Galway Bay. I selected this spot as the colours in the water really caught my eye. This photograph does not do it justice.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>The still grey light was so calm and peaceful. The only activity was a solitary boat dropping lobster pots and the seagulls who were busy and noisily feeding.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>As I tackled the sky, which at a glance looked grey, I took note of the beautiful warm tints of grey lower on the horizon and then flecks of pale yellow light between flecks of very pale grey clouds. Then there was a bluey grey bank of cloud in the middle of the composition fading to pale pink grey towards the left of the composition. It really was an exercise in greys. It fascinates me how the colours of the sand and stones are all altered so much from day to day or indeed hour by hour depending on the light and time of day.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>A cormorant was perched for ages on the rock in the water as if posing for the painting.  He will be in it of course!!   Many of the walkers this morning offered to pose for me!! People are so friendly and encouraging and such good fun even at that hour of the morning!!   The tide did it’s usual trick of going out on me, but no problem!</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>I really loved this morning’s time on the Prom!</p>

									<p>The weather obliged me this evening. I wanted to get the setting sunlight on the diving tower. There was a beautiful sunset behind me but I faced east and I painted the tower with the evening sky behind it. The light falling on the structure and the rocks was particularly beautiful.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>I painted the tower and sea first as tide was coming in and I wanted to catch it. I could see in the stones along the shore here all the pinks and blues reflected from the sky. They were highlighted by the light of the setting sun and added an interesting feature in the foreground. I left the sky until last as there was only a very short window to catch the sunset light on the sky. It gets dark so very quickly after the sun sets.</p>
									<p><br></p>
									<p>There were quite a few swimmers and very few of them were wearing wetsuits (hardy people). The refurbished walkway along golf links is very much used and is a great addition to the Prom. It was fairly mild considering the time of year and another beautiful evening on the Prom!!</p>
